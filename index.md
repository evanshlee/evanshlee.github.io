# 👋 Welcome to My Dev Blog 2

This is my personal space to document, reflect, and share ideas as a software developer.  
You'll find notes from what I'm learning, long-form posts on things I care about, and
reflections on books, movies, or conversations that moved me.

## 📚 Sections

- 📝 [Notes](notes/) — Quick learning logs, code snippets, and rough ideas
- 🗒️ [Posts](posts/) — More structured and thoughtful personal writings
- 💭 [Reflections](reflections/) — Reactions and thoughts based on media and experiences
